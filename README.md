# Twitter-SentimentAnalysis
A bot the searches twitter for keywords, retrieves tweets based upon those keywords, and analyzes the tweets for subjective/emotional content.

I wanted to familarize myself with Python, SQLite, and the Twitter API. I have had little experience with Python and SQLite before this, and no experience with the Twitter API. I wrote a paper on sentiment analysis and it made me interseted in working on a project that implemented the sentiment analysis techniques I studied.
